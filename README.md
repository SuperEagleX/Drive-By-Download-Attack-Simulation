# Drive-By-Download-Attack-Simulation
This project demonstrates a realistic Drive-by Download attack simulation in a controlled lab environment. The goal is to explore how attackers craft social engineering vectors and payload chains while providing cybersecurity defenders an educational example of what to look for.

# 🎯 Drive-by Download Simulation — Cybersecurity Educational Project

This project demonstrates a **Drive-by Download Attack Simulation** in a safe, offline lab environment for educational and awareness purposes. The setup mimics a fake Zoom/Teams software installer using social engineering and stealth payload delivery techniques.
